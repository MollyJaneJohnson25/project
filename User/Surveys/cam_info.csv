<h2>Title of Project: Understanding how 'social difficulties and 'sensory sensitivity' influence the nature of anxiety in high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder.</h2>

<h3>Researcher/ Student: Molly Johnson. Supervisor/ Chief investigator: Dr Indu Dubey</h3>

<h4>Invitation paragraph</h4>
I would like to invite you to take part in a study researching the nature of worry and how it is influenced by social and sensory factors in the environment. Before you begin, we would like you to understand why the research is being done and what it involves for you.<br><br>

<h4>What is the purpose of this study?</h4>
This study aims to gain an understanding into how social and sensory difficulties contribute to feelings of worry/ anxiety in adults with autism. There is limited research evaluating the impact of these factors and how they relate to one another, and I wish to explore this topic further.
Although this study may not benefit you directly, the information provided may help us to evaluate social and sensory difficulties as factors which contribute to anxiety and how these may be specific to autism. These conclusions could encourage larger studies to research the area in the future, which could lead to more autism specific anxiety interventions.<br><br>

<h4>Why have I been invited?</h4>
You have been invited because I am interested in investigating the nature of anxiety, as most adults have experienced worry at some stage in their life, anyone over the age of 18 is invited to participate. I am also recruiting adults who may self-identify as autistic to participate. You may have responded to advertisement yourself, or been referred by an organization, charity, or support group on my behalf. In either instance, this is why you have been sent this participant information sheet. You should know that participation in this study is completely optional. <br><br>

<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
It is entirely up to you to whether you choose to take part. If you do decide to take part, you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign an online consent form. You may change your mind about being involved at any time or decline to discuss a particular question. You are free to withdraw at any point before or during the study without giving a reason. If you choose to withdraw, we will no longer collect any information about you or from you and will delete your data. To safeguard your rights, we will use no personally identifiable information, therefore you will be given a participant ID number that will be used instead of your name. If you choose to withdraw, please close the browser, and email the researcher at lpymjj@nottingham.ac.uk with your participant ID number so that we can delete all your attached data. Please note however, you can only withdraw up to two days after the completion of the study.<br><br>

<h4>What will I be asked to do?</h4>
As this is an online study, if you choose to take part you will be asked to follow three separate internet links. Please only use a computer or laptop and NOT a mobile phone or tablet as key presses are required. The outline of the study is presented below. You will receive an email containing three links and a participant ID number that is unique to you, please do not share this with anyone. The links will be listed in the order that they should be completed.
<h4>The first link</h4>
• The first link will take you through a 50-item scale asking about your day-to-day behaviours,
this will be followed by a 44-item scale relating to your experience of worry and upon completion the main task will begin. In this game you will be asked to choose between two boxes, each with between 1-3 locks on. The locks represent the number of key presses that need to be made to reveal a video. There will be 4 practice trials followed by 60 real ones. Once this is finished, you will be asked to respond to a 24-item scale relating to your social preferences. This stage should take no longer than 45 minutes.
<h4>The second link</h4>
• The second link will direct you straight to a slightly different version of the game that you
played in the first task. You are required to respond to the boxes in the same way, the only difference is in the type of videos that will be revealed. Again, there will be 4 practice trials followed by 60 real ones. Once this is finished, you will be asked to respond to a 27-item scale relating to your sensory preferences. This stage should take no longer than 35 minutes.
<h4>The third link</h4>
• The third link will take you to a questionnaire which will ask you to briefly write about your
experience of anxiety in day-to-day life and how you felt experiencing the CAM tasks. You are free to answer in as little or as much detail as you wish. Your responses will be completely anonymous so there is no way of identifying you, however to ensure this we as that you do not include any personal details within your responses. Completion of the questionnaire should take no longer than 15 minutes.
Please be aware that you do not have to complete all three links within one sitting, you are encouraged to take breaks between the sections and ensure that you are situated within a comfortable environment. Relevant instructions will also be repeated at the beginning of each task so you do not need to remember the precise details. In total, it should not take much longer than an hour and a half to complete the study, although as mentioned previously, response times can be variable.<br><br>

<h4>What will happen to the information I provide?</h4>
All data collected across the study will be remain confidential and will be stored on a limited number of password protected devices that can only be accessed by myself. Upon consenting to the investigation, you will be given a participant ID number which will be used instead of your name, any information you provide which could be used to identify you will be kept separately from your data. Any emails sent from me containing your ID number/ personal information will be deleted upon completion of the study, therefore if you would like to withdraw your data, please include your ID number within the email so that your responses can be identified. Please also be aware that your anonymous data may be shared with other researchers who are also investigating the same topic.<br><br>

<h4>Are there any possible disadvantages or risks in taking part?</h4>
We don’t expect there to be any disadvantages or risks to taking part. However, you should be aware that participation in each of the CAM tasks will take up to 35 minutes, therefore please only take part if you have the time to do so. It should also be considered that some may find concentrating on ambiguous video clips difficult, if you believe that you may find this too challenging then it would be advised that you do not participate. Similarly, the same would apply if you do not feel comfortable being asked about your experience of anxiety/ worry. In the unlikely event that this study does give rise to any concerns for you, please use this email (lpymjj@nottingham.ac.uk) to contact myself and I will deal with the issue directly.

This would be used for research in health and social care. Sharing research data is important to allow peer scrutiny, re-use (and therefore avoiding duplication of research) and to understand the bigger picture in particular areas of research. All personal information that could identify you will be removed or changed before information is shared with other researchers or results are made public.
The data collected for the study will be looked at and stored by authorised persons from the University of Nottingham who are organising the research.
