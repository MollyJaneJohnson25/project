<h2>Title of Project: Understanding how 'social difficulties and 'sensory sensitivity' influence the nature of anxiety in high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder.</h2>

<h3>Researcher/ Student: Molly Johnson. Supervisor/ Chief investigator: Dr Indu Dubey</h3>

<h4>Invitation paragraph</h4>
I would like to invite you to take part in a study researching the nature of worry and how it is influenced by social and sensory factors in the environment. Before you begin, we would like you to understand why the research is being done and what it involves for you.<br><br>

<h4>What is the purpose of this study?</h4>
This study aims to gain an understanding into how social and sensory difficulties contribute to feelings of worry/ anxiety in adults with autism. There is limited research evaluating the impact of these factors and how they relate to one another, and I wish to explore this topic further.
Although this study may not benefit you directly, the information provided may help us to evaluate social and sensory difficulties as factors which contribute to anxiety and how these may be specific to autism. These conclusions could encourage larger studies to research the area in the future, which could lead to more autism specific anxiety interventions.<br><br>

<h4>Why have I been invited?</h4>
You have been invited because I am interested in investigating the nature of anxiety, as most adults have experienced worry at some stage in their life, anyone over the age of 18 is invited to participate. I am also recruiting adults who may self-identify as autistic to participate. You may have responded to advertisement yourself, or been referred by an organization, charity, or support group on my behalf. In either instance, this is why you have been sent this participant information sheet. You should know that participation in this study is completely optional. <br><br>

<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
It is entirely up to you to whether you choose to take part. If you do decide to take part, you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign an online consent form. You may change your mind about being involved at any time or decline to discuss a particular question. You are free to withdraw at any point before or during the study without giving a reason. If you choose to withdraw, we will no longer collect any information about you or from you and will delete your data. To safeguard your rights, we will use no personally identifiable information, therefore you will be given a participant ID number that will be used instead of your name. If you choose to withdraw, please close the browser, and email the researcher at lpymjj@nottingham.ac.uk with your participant ID number so that we can delete all your attached data. Please note however, you can only withdraw up to two days after the completion of the study.<br><br>

<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>

If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time during the data collection without giving a reason.<br><br>

<h4>I am interested in taking part, what do I do next?</h4>
Please contact the researcher who’s contact details are shared in the advertisement. The researcher will then send you an email with your unique participation code and links to the online study. Please find a quiet room with minimal distractions. Please ensure you have a good internet connection on a PC / laptop / tablet device. Please do not run the study on a mobile phone. Every person completes the tasks with different speed however we expect that it may take you between 35 – 45 minutes to complete each link. Make sure that you have sufficient time to complete each part of the study. Once ready please follow the link to the online study.<br><br>

<h4>What if I agree to take part and then change my mind?</h4>
If you would like to withdraw from the study before completing the tasks, you will be able to do this by closing the browser. Since we would not know if the task was skipped due to technical error or you wished to withdraw, you would need to provide your participation ID to the researchers. Researcher will then delete all the data generated by that ID. You can withdraw from the study at any stage including after the completing the study, without giving a reason. If you decide to withdraw you would need to provide your participation ID to the researchers. The researcher will then delete all the data generated by that ID from their computers. Please note that you can withdraw from the study only up to two days after the completion of the study. <br><br>

<h4>What is the procedure that is being tested?</h4>
You will be asked to participate in the study using your private computer/laptop/tablet device but NOT mobile phones. <br><br>

<h4>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h4>
Participation in this study can be tiring as each part may take approximately 35-45 minutes to respond to various questions and game on computer. Therefore, it is suggested that you take part only when you are feeling ready to spend required time on the tasks. Also, for some people making choices, looking at randomly chosen video clips of natural scenes, smiling people, or any ambiguity can be difficult to deal with. If you think you may feel distressed by these then we advise you not to participate in the study. <br><br>

<h4>What are the possible benefits of taking part? </h4>
There is no direct benefit to the participants however your participation will help us understanding the nature of worry in autism. This can then help in developing suitable interventions for the same. <br><br>
